# Zelda Memory Game
A memory game in which a player clicks cards without repeating. When a card is clicked, the order of the cards is randomized. 

## Technologies Used
- React (with Vite for project set-up)
- Node.js (package management)
- Zelda API ([Hyrule Compendium API](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/))

## Features
### Odin Requirements
- Scoreboard to track current score
- Best Score, which shows the highest score achieved thus far
- Function to display cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one
- Cards, images, and possibly display text fetched from an external API
- Project deployment

### Additional Requirements
- World clock with selectable timezones

### Additional Features
- The game is tabbable
- Pulls random images from the API so that the game is slightly different upon reload
